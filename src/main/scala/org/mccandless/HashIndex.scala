/**
 * Similar to the default storage engine in riak.
 *
 * well suited to situations where the value for each key is updated frequently.
 * For example, the key might be the URL of a cat video, and the value might be the number of times
 * it has been played (incremented every time someone hits the play button).
 * In this kind of workload, there are a lot of writes, but there are not too many distinct keys.
 * you have a large number of writes per key, but itâ€™s feasible to keep all keys in memory.
